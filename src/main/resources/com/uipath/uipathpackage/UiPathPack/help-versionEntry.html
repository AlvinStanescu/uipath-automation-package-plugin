    Chose the way you want the NuGet package to be versioned.<br>
    You can opt for the same way UiPath Studio does the versioning by default, generating automatically a pseudo-random
    version for each package or you can opt for specifying a certain version.<br>
    The second option will allow you to customize your versioning for better package tracking.<br>
    In the situation of packaging multiple projects the same version will be applied for each of them.

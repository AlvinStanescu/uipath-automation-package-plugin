<div>
    Select the location of the project or projects that you want to package.
    <br>
    It can be only one project, situation in which you'll have to specify the full path to its project.json file (i.e.
    /Path/To/Process/project.json) or it can be a folder that contains other projects.
    <br>
    In the second case all the projects that exist on a depth of one level in the folder hierarchy will be packaged
    individually.
